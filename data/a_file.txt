hello everyone
Strings in java are immutable, meaning if you jus
t call new String(char_array) it will make an interna
l immutable copy of the array. Any changes to the ori
ginal char_array will not be reflected in the new string
. StringBuilder, however, is using a pac
age private constructor String(char[] value, boolean share). It act
ually allows it to use a shared array
. But now it has to make sure this shared array is not modi
fied. So it makes a copy and creates a string with
